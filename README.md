## About
### How to use it
My cool app 😎 Star-wars-pedia searchs for films of the Star Wars saga in which appears the searches you make! You can search for your favorite characters 🤖, the most curious planets 🌍, the fastest vehicles and the most incredible starships 🛸 ! Simply remember to follow the instructions you find in the Home page.

Want some more info?? I knew that, that's why I'm implemented the featured Film Detail. You just need to click on the film you'd like to know more and enjoy! Open an issue 🦄 on GitHub if you'd want me to add more info.

The api I've used is [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/).
### Features
- Search for films only by adding words from your characters, etc, such as: `luke r2 tatooine`
- Visit the film detail to know further
- Go back to the previous search without losing the results of your search
- Want to start over? Just click the reset button!
- Maybe more to come soon! 🦄

### Further development
- Behavioural tests with Cypress
- More features that the Star Wars fans ask me for via GitHub issues! 😎
