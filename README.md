## About
### How to use it
My cool app 😎 Star-wars-pedia searchs for films of the Star Wars saga in which appears the searches you make! You can search for your favorite characters 🤖, the most curious planets 🌍, the fastest vehicles and the most incredible starships 🛸 ! Simply remember to follow the instructions you find in the Home page.

Want some more info?? I knew that, that's why I'm implemented the featured Film Detail. You just need to click on the film you'd like to know more and enjoy! Open an issue 🦄 on GitHub if you'd want me to add more info.

The api I've used is [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/).

### Features
- Search for films only by adding words from your characters, etc, such as: `luke r2 tatooine`
- Visit the film detail to know further
- Go back to the previous search without losing the results of your search
- Maybe more features coming soon, just ask !! 🦄

### Want to practice your coding skills with a cool app?
Here I'm adding some User Stories than can help you building from scratch this app. First, remember, you can use the stack that you want!
- As a user, I want to be able to search for different things in the star wars universe: names, starships, planets or even vehicles
- As a user, I want to see the list of the common films in which the _things_ I searched appear, and also clearly the terms I searched for
- As a user, I want to search to be smooth despite I enter weird characters
- As a user, I want to clearly see whether my search was unfruitful
- As a user, I want to see for each film the name, episode, release date and how old the film is
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a film and see more details about it, such as the Director, the Producer and the release date again
- As a user, I want to go back to the home page and see that my search and films are still there
- As a user, I want to be able to share the url with my friends so they can see my search and the common films
